The task is running these scripts using [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) on various Linux VMs and accessing the Linux VMs through windows' mstsc utility and use the Linux VMs in the same way as we use our day to day computer systems like Desktop, Laptops etc. without taking the tension of buying costly hardwares and physical storage space.

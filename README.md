## BrainChange-Scripts
### NOTE : The scripts are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS platform.
### This scripts are tested and verified on Linux VMs (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) on the [Google Cloud Platform]( https://cloud.google.com/). The task is running these scripts  on various Linux VMs using [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) utility on windows, accessing the Linux VMs through windows mstsc utility and use the Linux VMs in the same way as we use our day to day computer systems like Desktop, Laptops etc. without taking the tension of buying costly hardwares and physical storage space.
#### Tip-1 : Any ssh client utility can be used. PuTTY was used here because the work was done purely on windows.
#### Tip-2 : Win +R and run 'mstsc'
